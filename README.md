# üèÅ For Mary ‚Äî A Forest-Themed Racing Game in C++

**For Mary** is a 2D side-scrolling racing game developed in C++ as part of a university course on C++ Programming. Inspired by *Expresso Racing* from *Donkey Kong Country 2*, the game features retro forest aesthetics, simple controls, and fast-paced action.

Players race through scrolling forest tracks, avoiding obstacles and outpacing AI opponents. The gameplay emphasizes timing, quick reactions, and a bit of arcade-style fun. While the graphics and design are intentionally simple, the core mechanics demonstrate key programming concepts like object-oriented design, real-time input handling, and custom game loops.

The entire game is built using the C++ Simple Game Graphics (SGG) library. It includes basic physics, collision detection, and a clean modular code structure that reflects good software development practices. Link to library: https://github.com/cgaueb/sgg
